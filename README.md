INST 327 – Database Design and Modeling  Team Project Plan - See Canvas for the deadline Report Requirements
Ensure that your team understands the report requirements; if you have any questions please ask the instructor as soon as possible. Your team may lose points if you do not follow all of the instructions.

This report should be 2-3 pages long including tables and diagrams.

Discuss and explain your plans for team meetings, including acknowledgement of challenges to your specific team, such as members who commute or have time-consuming internships or jobs, and the inevitable no-common-free-time problem. How will you address the challenges? (Suggestion: consider use of remote meeting, file sharing, and collaborative document technologies.)

Addressing Schedule Conflicts (Ebonie): 


Describe your project team approach regarding team member roles. Depending on your approach, either indicate shared responsibility or designate roles for specific team members. Note: it is perfectly fine if these roles evolve or change over the course of semester. However, it might be a good idea to identify members who will play roles that involve coordinating, communicating, and motivating the team for progress.

Present two or three finalists for your team project topic with brief descriptions. In the next deliverable, the Project Proposal, you will choose one of these and provide much more detail. In this report, you should provide just enough description (2-3 sentences) for each idea to demonstrate that the idea would work for the scope of the semester-long project.
